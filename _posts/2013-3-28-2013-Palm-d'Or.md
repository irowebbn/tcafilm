It is the year 2098. As a direct result of the world's insane love for bacon, Vandergeld Meat Products, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vandergeld Heavy Industries, dominates 95% of the world economy. Its owner, Mr. Vandergeld, is the most powerful and least reasonable man to ever roll upon this presently God-forsaken earth.

When Eugene, a genetic experiment to create a new meat, escapes his flavorful prison in the meat refinery, there is only one product cheaper and greasier than the meats made by Vandergeld Meat Products that can stop the havok he is causing. (Hint: It's mostly just petroleum byproducts.)

May God help us all.

It's in French because this was a project for French class. We've added English subtitles so that it's understandable to the largely-French-ignorant population of the United States.

Being part of said population, we may have butchered the French at a few points in the video (Err, the French language, not the French people). Therefore, post a comment if our linguistic inadequacy provokes any profound feelings, facial expressions, or life-long passions for revenge.

We may re-do this video but make it waaaaaay better and in English, so check back in a couple blue moons.
